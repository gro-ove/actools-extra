### [AC Banners Tool](https://github.com/gro-ove/actools-extra/tree/master/AcTools.Extra.BannersTool)

A small utility allowing to quickly fix semi-transparent windscreen banners by stretching alpha-channel the way semi-transparent areas become opaque (thus preserving gradients).

Simply put a file called Rules.txt (example included) next to executable and launch it, or use command line to adjust behavior using list of parameters.
